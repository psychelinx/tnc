**Privacy Notice Information on the Processing of Personal Data pursuant to Art. 13 GDPR**  

In accordance with Article 13 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”), Psychelinx Ltd. is providing you with this notice explaining how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use the **Psychelinx** app.

*Data Controller*

The Data Controller is Psychelinx Ltd., registered office at 86–90 Paul Street, London EC2A 4NE, United Kingdom, and can be contacted at the following address: [info@psychelinx.com](mailto:info@psychelinx.com)

*Purposes and Legal Basis of Personal Data Processing*

Psychelinx processes your personal data in order to create and manage your account for use of the app. The lawful basis for this processing is Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR – processing necessary for the performance of a contract.
Psychelinx may also process your personal data for administrative and accounting purposes, including the invoicing of the services provided. The lawful basis for this processing is Article 6(1)(c) UK GDPR, as the processing is necessary for compliance with legal obligations to which Psychelinx is subject under applicable tax and accounting laws.

*Data Retention*

Personal data collected for registration and account management will be retained and processed for as long as you use the app and, in general, avail of the services provided by the Controller.  If your account remains inactive  for 6 consecutive months, your registration data will be deleted or anonymised. This retention and deletion process applies only to the registration data collected by Psychelinx.

*Data Sharing*

Your personal data may be accessed by employees and contractors of Psychelinx, duly appointed and authorised to process personal data in accordance with the Article 29 GDPR. In addition, our email service provider acts as a data processor on the Controller's behalf under Article 28 UK GDPR.

As Psychelinx is established in the United Kingdom, personal data may be stored or processed here. This transfer is lawful and does not require your consent; the European Commission has recognised the UK as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/1772 of 28 June 2021 under the GDPR).

*Your Rights*

You have the following rights under Articles 15–21 UK GDPR:
- Right of access – to obtain confirmation of whether we process your data and to receive a copy.
- Right to rectification – to correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Right to erasure – to request deletion of your data in certain circumstances.
- Right to restrict processing – to request that we limit use of your data.
- Right to object – to object to processing on certain grounds.
- Right to data portability – to receive your data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format and to transmit it to another controller.

Where data processing is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before consent was withdrawn.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority, pursuant to Article 77(1) GDPR. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). You may also complain to another supervisory authority in the EU if you live or work there, or if the alleged infringement occurred in that Member State.

You may exercise your rights by contacting Psychelinx in writing using the details provided above.
