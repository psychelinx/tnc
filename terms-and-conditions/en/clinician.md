6. *Purpose and description of the services provided*
Through the App, the Healthcare Professional, duly qualified and registered with the relevant professional body, may collect data, information and notes concerning the psychological condition of the User under their care, in order to support their activities of observation, monitoring, assessment and clinical diagnosis. Such data collection, in support of the Professional’s activity, may also take place through a questionnaire that the Professional may customise according to the specific needs of the User under their care.
The App also includes a dashboard function allowing data and information to be filtered by selected time periods.
The App further enables the Professional to manage the personal psychological diary of multiple Users by selecting the relevant User each time.
The App is a mere support tool and does not replace the Professional’s clinical judgment, who remains solely responsible for diagnosis, monitoring, and clinical and therapeutic evaluation.

7. *Eligibility requirements for the Professional*
The App may only be used by Healthcare Professionals who are duly qualified and registered with their relevant professional body.
The Professional represents and warrants that they meet this requirement under the applicable laws and undertakes to promptly inform the Provider of any circumstances that may affect their registration or professional qualification.
The Professional is strictly prohibited from using the App on a device that is jailbroken, rooted or otherwise compromised.

8. *Registration and management of credentials*
To use the services of the App, the Professional must register by creating a personal account.
At registration, the Professional must provide accurate, up-to-date and complete information and undertakes to promptly update any information that changes after account creation.
The Professional may create an account by providing their e-mail address, which will be used as the username, and by selecting a password that complies with the security requirements imposed by the Provider.
The Professional may not assign or otherwise transfer their account or any rights arising under this Contract to third parties.
The Professional must keep their credentials confidential and is responsible for the security and diligent custody of their access credentials, which must not be disclosed to third parties. The Professional must immediately inform the Provider if their credentials are lost, stolen, compromised or otherwise used without authorisation.
The Professional is responsible for all activities carried out through their account, unless they can demonstrate that such activities are not attributable to them, even by negligence.
Any misuse of credentials due to the Professional’s negligence releases the Provider from all liability.

9. *Service costs*
Use of the app is subject to the subscription of a paid plan, which may be annual, quarterly or monthly and may have different features depending on the plan selected.
The applicable fees, plus VAT and any other statutory charges, are those indicated on the website https://www.psychelinx.com/pages/pricing-clinician and/or made available through the relevant app store at the time the subscription is purchased. Where the app is distributed via an app store, store service fees or commissions may apply, over which the provider has no control or responsibility.

Subscription payments shall be made in advance and in Pound (GBP), using the payment methods made available by the app store at the time of subscription.

10. *Term of the Contract*
This contract shall be effective for a period corresponding to the duration of the subscription purchased, starting from the moment when the provider, including via the relevant app store, confirms receipt of payment for the subscription.
Upon expiry of the above period, the subscription shall automatically renew, with the applicable fee charged automatically, unless the professional terminates, suspends or cancels the subscription directly through the app store from which the app was purchased. Professionals are therefore invited to review the terms and conditions of the relevant app store.

11. *Termination of the Contract by the Provider*
The Provider may terminate this Contract at any time by giving the Professional 15 (fifteen) days’ prior notice by e-mail to the address provided during registration, unless termination is for just cause as described below, in which case termination shall take immediate effect.

(a) if the Professional breaches any obligations under this Contract;
(b) if the Professional violates applicable law;
(c) in any case of non-performance by the Professional;
(d) to comply with a request from public authorities.
In the event of termination of the contract not attributable to the professional, the provider shall refund the portion of the fees paid proportionate to the remaining term of the contract.

12. *Disclaimer of liability*
The Professional acknowledges that the Provider is neither a healthcare professional nor a healthcare facility and therefore does not perform healthcare activities, acting solely as a technical service provider and intermediary.
The Provider is not involved in the relationship between the Professional and the User. The Provider is not and does not become a party to any relationship between the Professional and the User, nor does it act as agent, intermediary, insurer or guarantor. The Professional therefore remains solely responsible for correctly identifying the User, within their duty of care.

- App inaccessibility may result from the Professional’s device problems, battery failure or inadequate Internet connectivity, for which the Provider is not responsible.
	The App must not be used by the Professional as the sole tool for diagnosis or monitoring of the User’s health.
	The Provider will use reasonable efforts to ensure service continuity but shall not be held liable for any malfunctions, interruptions, data loss or system anomalies should they occur.

13. *Suspension of the service*
The Provider may, at any time and without notice, temporarily or permanently suspend the service for technical, security or extraordinary maintenance reasons, as well as in the event of the Professional’s breach of these Terms and Conditions. Such suspension shall not give rise to any right to compensation.
The Provider shall not be liable for any suspension, restriction or inability to download, update or use the App resulting from unilateral decisions taken by the Stores.

14. *Personal Data Protection*
The Provider is the Controller of the Professional’s personal data, which it processes in compliance with applicable data protection law, including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) and the Data Protection Act 2018. Specific information regarding the processing of the Professional’s personal data by the Provider is set out in the Privacy Notice made available to the Professional via the App.
With regard to Users’ personal data, the Professional acknowledges that they act as an independent Controller for purposes of diagnosis, monitoring and care, and hereby appoints the Provider as Processor on their behalf, entrusting it with the processing operations described in the Data Processing Agreement pursuant to Article 28 UK GDPR, which forms an integral part of these T&C.
 
15. *Intellectual property*
All rights in the App, its source code, graphics, logos and general informational content are the exclusive property of the Provider, unless otherwise indicated, and are protected under applicable civil and criminal law.
The Professional is granted a personal, non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-transferable right of use, limited to the functionalities described in Article 6 of these Terms and Conditions.
The Professional is prohibited from reproducing, copying, modifying, distributing, selling, licensing, reverse engineering, translating into other languages, extracting the source code or creating derivative versions of the App or any part thereof, unless prior written consent has been obtained from the Provider.

Pursuant to Regulation 9 of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002, the Provider informs the Professional that this Contract shall only be concluded upon completion of the following technical steps by the Professional: (a) entering their e-mail address and creating a password that complies with the Provider’s security requirements; (b) reviewing and accepting these Terms and Conditions by clicking the relevant box; (c) reviewing the information on the processing of personal data by ticking the relevant box; (d) entering, on the designated App screen, the confirmation code contained in the e-mail sent by the Provider following registration; (e) select the subscription plan and the payment method from the available options and proceed with payment.
The contract shall be deemed concluded at the moment when the provider acknowledges receipt of confirmation of the payment made by the professional.
The Provider will send the Professional a copy of these Terms and Conditions and of the Privacy Notice to the e-mail address provided during registration.
The Provider allows the Professional to identify and correct any data entry errors before submitting the registration request, by displaying a summary screen of the data, which can be amended as necessary prior to final submission.
The Contract is available in Italian and English.
Dispute resolution mechanisms are set out in Article 18 of these Terms and Conditions.

17. *Governing Law and Jurisdiction*
The provision of the services is governed by these Terms and Conditions and by the laws of England and Wales.
The above provision shall not apply if the laws of the country where the Professional resides require the application of different laws or jurisdiction, and such requirement cannot lawfully be excluded by contract.

18. Dispute Resolution
Should the professional wish to submit a complaint to the provider, they may do so by writing to the certified email address: psychelinx@pec.it .
This does not affect the right to bring proceedings before the courts. In such case, any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including those relating to its validity, interpretation, performance or non-performance, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

19. *Unilateral Amendments by the Provider*
Psychelinx Ltd. reserves the right to update or otherwise modify these Terms and Conditions from time to time. The provider shall inform professionals of any changes by means of a notice within the app or by sending an email to the email address provided by the professional, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such changes enter into force. Where the professional does not agree with the amended terms, they may withdraw from this contract with immediate effect.
Where the contractual change concerns a modification of the subscription fee, the professional shall have the right to disable automatic renewal, with the consequence that they will no longer be able to use Psychelinx services upon expiry of the then-current subscription period. In such case, the withdrawal shall not affect subscriptions already purchased prior to the withdrawal, which shall remain valid until full performance of the parties’ respective obligations in relation to those subscriptions.
If the professional does not exercise their right of withdrawal within thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the new contractual terms, such terms shall be deemed accepted as updated or amended.
The date of the most recent revision shall be indicated at the bottom of this Terms and Conditions of Use page, and any changes shall take effect from the date of publication.
