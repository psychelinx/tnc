An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, online identifier or one or more factors specific to their physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. For the purposes of the app, all personal information collected that can be linked to the User – including emotions, moods, daily events and dates – is considered Personal Data.
• “*Controller*”: the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

• “*Terms and Conditions*” or “*T&Cs*”: the contractual document governing the relationship between the User and the Provider, setting out rights, obligations, liability limitations and rules for use of the app.
• “*Jailbroken Device*”, “*Rooted Device*” or “*Compromised Device*”: any mobile device on which the security restrictions imposed by the manufacturer or operating system have been removed or altered, or which is otherwise exposed to vulnerabilities that compromise data integrity, security or confidentiality (including, by way of example, installation of unofficial firmware, unauthorised apps or modifications to the operating system).
• “*In-app Notification*”: any electronic communication made available by the Provider within the app and viewable by the User when accessing or using it, including, by way of example, pop-ups, banners, internal push messages or message centre sections. For the purposes of this Contract, in-app notifications are deemed validly received by the User at the time they are made available in the app.

5. *Provider Identity and Contact Details*
The Psychelinx App is provided by Psychelinx Ltd., a company incorporated and registered in England and Wales under company number 16442933, with its registered office at 86-90 Paul Street, London, EC2A 4NE, United Kingdom (hereinafter, the “Provider”).
The Provider may be contacted at: info@psychelinx.com

6. *Scope and description of the services*
Through the App, the User may use a personal digital psychological diary to record daily emotions, moods, subjective feelings and significant events. The User may also complete, through the App, any questionnaires that the Healthcare Professional has previously prepared specifically for that User.
The App also includes a dashboard feature that allows data and information to be filtered by the time period selected for viewing.
The App does not itself perform any diagnostic, therapeutic or clinical assessment function. It serves solely as a tool for the digitised collection of personal information for the User’s private use, which the User may share with their Healthcare Professional.

7. *User eligibility requirements*
Use of the App is permitted only by Users who are at least eighteen (18) years of age. By accessing or using the App, the User represents and warrants that they are at least eighteen years old.
The User’s use of the App is restricted exclusively to personal purposes and not for commercial or professional use.
The User is further prohibited from using the App if their device is jailbroken, rooted or otherwise compromised.

8. *Registration and management of credentials*
To access the App’s services, the User must register by creating a personal account. 
At this stage, the User must provide truthful, up-to-date and complete information and undertakes to update such information promptly if it changes after registration.
The User may create their account by providing their email address, which will serve as the username, and by selecting a password in accordance with the security requirements established by the Provider.
The User may not assign or otherwise transfer their account or any rights arising under this Contract to third parties.
The User must maintain confidentiality and is responsible for the security and careful custody of their access credentials, which must not be disclosed to third parties.

The User will be held responsible for all actions carried out through their account, unless they can demonstrate that such activities are in no way attributable to them, even by negligence.
Any improper use of credentials attributable to the User’s negligence releases the Provider from all liability.

9. *Service costs*
The Provider does not require the User to pay any fee for use of the services. However, the User shall bear any costs of their Internet connection.

10. *Term of the Contract*
This Contract shall take effect from the date on which the User’s account is created and shall remain in force until it is terminated by either the User or the Provider,

11. *User’s right of withdrawal*
Given that the App is made available free of charge, the User may withdraw from the services provided through the App by deleting their account at any time, thereby ceasing to use the App.

12. *Termination of the Contract by the Provider*
The Provider may terminate this Contract at any time by giving the User fifteen (15) days’ prior notice via in-app notification, except where termination is for cause as described below, in which case termination shall take immediate effect.
The Provider may terminate this Contract with immediate effect and without notice:
(a) if the User breaches any obligations under this Contract;
(b) if the User breaches applicable laws or regulations;
(c) in the event of any default by the User;
(d) in order to comply with a request from public authorities.

13. *Disclaimer of liability*
The User acknowledges that the Provider is neither a healthcare professional nor a healthcare facility and therefore does not engage in the practice of healthcare, acting solely as an intermediary and provider of technical services.
The Provider is independent from the relationship between the User and the Healthcare Professional and does not and shall not become a party to any such relationship, nor does it act as an agent, intermediary, insurer or guarantor.
Similarly, the Provider is in no way responsible for the activity or outcome of any diagnosis, clinical assessment or therapeutic indication provided by the Healthcare Professional, nor for the Healthcare Professional’s compliance with applicable healthcare or professional ethical regulations.
The User acknowledges and agrees that:
- the App does not in any way replace a professional medical or psychological consultation;
- information entered into the App is not verified by the Provider, which has no responsibility for the content or accuracy of information shared by the User;
- the App does not provide diagnoses, therapeutic recommendations or healthcare interventions;
- any decisions concerning the User’s mental health must be taken exclusively in collaboration with qualified Healthcare Professionals;
- the Provider is not liable for errors caused by third-party data sources or infrastructure providers, including but not limited to network and Internet connectivity services, cloud hosting services, identity verification services and payment platforms;
- inaccessibility of the App may result from issues with the User’s device, battery failure or insufficient Internet connection, for which the Provider accepts no responsibility.
	Use of the App as the sole tool for evaluating one’s psychological state is strongly discouraged. In an emergency, the User must promptly contact emergency services by dialling the relevant numbers or going to the nearest emergency facility.
	The Provider undertakes to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, continuity of the service but cannot be held liable for any malfunctions, interruptions, data loss or system anomalies that may occur.

14. *Suspension of the service*
The Provider may, at any time and without notice, temporarily or permanently suspend the service for technical, security or extraordinary maintenance reasons, as well as in the event of the User’s breach of these Terms and Conditions. Such suspension shall not give rise to any right to compensation.
The Provider shall not be liable for any suspension, restriction or inability to download, update or use the App resulting from unilateral decisions taken by the Stores.

15. *Personal data protection*
With regard to the User’s personal data, the Provider may act both as Data Controller and as Data Processor.
The Provider acts as Data Controller when it independently processes the User’s personal data for the purposes of registration and account creation. However, for purposes of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment, the Healthcare Professional acts as an independent Data Controller, and in such case the Provider acts as their Data Processor, appointed pursuant to Article 28 of the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.
In all cases, the personal data entered by the User into the App is processed in compliance with the applicable data protection legislation, including the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Specific information regarding the processing of personal data carried out by the Provider is contained in the Privacy Policy made available to the User through the App.

16. *Intellectual property*
All rights in the App, its source code, graphics, logos and general informational content are the exclusive property of the Provider, unless otherwise indicated, and are protected under applicable civil and criminal law.
The User is granted a personal, non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-transferable right of use, limited to the functionalities described in Article 6 of these Terms and Conditions.
The User is prohibited from reproducing, copying, modifying, distributing, selling, licensing, reverse engineering, translating into other languages, extracting the source code or creating derivative versions of the App or any part thereof, unless prior written consent has been obtained from the Provider.

17. *Information pursuant to the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002*

(c) review the information regarding the processing of personal data by ticking the dedicated box; (d) enter, in the relevant screen of the App, the confirmation code contained in the email sent by the Provider following registration. The Contract shall be deemed concluded once the Provider has acknowledged receipt of the User’s registration confirmation.
The Provider will send the User a copy of these Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy to the email address provided at registration.
The Provider enables the User to identify and correct any data entry errors before submitting the registration request, by displaying a summary screen of the data which can be modified before final submission.
The Contract is available in Italian and English.
The methods of dispute resolution are set out in Article 19 of these Terms and Conditions.

18. *Governing law and jurisdiction*
The provision of services is governed by these Terms and Conditions and by the laws of England and Wales. For Users who qualify as consumers, the mandatory consumer protection provisions under applicable law in their country of residence shall also apply.
The above shall not apply where the laws in the User’s country of residence require the application of a different law or jurisdiction, and such requirement cannot be excluded by contract.

19. *Dispute resolution*
If the User wishes to lodge a complaint against the Provider, they may do so by writing to the following address: info@psychelinx.com .
If the dispute cannot be resolved, the Provider informs the User that they may refer the matter to an Alternative Dispute Resolution (“ADR”) body. For cross-border disputes, consumer Users may contact the UK European Consumer Centre (UK ECC) or the equivalent body in their country of residence.
This does not affect the User’s right to bring legal proceedings before the competent courts. For consumer Users, jurisdiction will lie with the courts of their place of residence, as required by applicable consumer protection law.

20. *Amendments to the Contract*
Psychelinx Ltd. reserves the right to update or otherwise amend these Terms and Conditions in the future. The Provider will inform Users of any changes by means of an in-app notification. The date of the revisions will be indicated at the bottom of this Terms and Conditions page, and any changes will take effect from the time of publication.
Continued use of the App by the User shall constitute acceptance of the contractual amendments.
